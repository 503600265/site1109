# Label
This is a web application that is created with an intended usage of allowing users to input their own labels. In the page you can add your label, rename your label and delete your label. The system has its own login section, where the session would remember the user and userâ€™s labels. When user store their labels, the labels would update to the database, and when user come back to the website page, the updated added label would be showed on current user the page.
